It is widely supported across modern editors & build systems and can be customized with your own lint rules, configurations, and formatters.\n\nTSLint supports:\n\n- custom lint rules\n- custom formatters (failure reporters)\n- inline disabling and enabling of rules with comment flags\n- configuration presets (`tslint:latest`, `tslint-react`, etc.) and plugin composition\n- automatic fixing of formatting & style violations\n- integration with [MSBuild](https://github.com/joshuakgoldberg/tslint.msbuild), [Grunt](https://github.com/palantir/grunt-tslint), [Gulp](https://github.com/panuhorsmalahti/gulp-tslint), [Atom](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-tslint), [Eclipse](https://github.com/palantir/eclipse-tslint), [Emacs](http://flycheck.org), [Sublime](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-tslint), [Vim](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic), [Visual Studio 2015](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.WebAnalyzer), [Visual Studio 2017](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RichNewman.TypeScriptAnalyzer) [Visual Studio code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint), [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/help/tslint.html) and [more](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/third-party-tools/)\n\nInstallation & Usage\n------------\n\nPlease refer to the full installation & usage documentation on the [TSLint website](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/). There, you'll find information about\n- [configuration](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/configuration/),\n- [core rules](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/),\n- [core formatters](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/formatters/), and\n- [customization of TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/develop/custom-rules/).\n- [inline disabling and enabling of rules with comment flags](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/)\n\nCustom Rules & Plugins\n------------\n\n#### Custom rule sets from Palantir\n\n- [tslint-react](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-react) - Lint rules related to React & JSX.\n- [tslint-blueprint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-blueprint) - Lint rules to enforce best practices with [blueprintjs libraries](https://github.com/palantir/blueprint)\n\n#### Custom rule sets from the community\n\nIf we don't have all the rules you're looking for, you can either write your own [custom rules](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/develop/custom-rules/) or use rules implementations developed by the community. The repos below are a good source of custom rules:\n\n- [ESLint rules for TSLint](https://github.com/buzinas/tslint-eslint-rules) - Improve your TSLint with the missing ESLint Rules\n- [tslint-microsoft-contrib](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib) - A set of TSLint rules used on some Microsoft projects\n- [codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer) - A set of tslint rules for static code analysis of Angular TypeScript projects\n- [vrsource-tslint-rules](https://github.com/vrsource/vrsource-tslint-rules)\n- [tslint-immutable](https://github.com/jonaskello/tslint-immutable) - TSLint rules to disable mutation in TypeScript\n- [tslint-consistent-codestyle](https://github.com/ajafff/tslint-consistent-codestyle) - TSLint rules to enforce consistent code style in TypeScript\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nRequirements:\n\n- `node` v7\n- `yarn` v0.23+\n\n#### Quick Start\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:palantir/tslint.git --config core.autocrlf=input --config core.eol=lf\nyarn\nyarn compile\nyarn test\n```\n\nCreating a new release\n----------------------\n\n1. Bump the version number in `package.json` and `src/linter.ts`\n2. Add release notes in `CHANGELOG.md`\n    - Use `./scripts/generate-changelog.js` (after building it with `tsc -p scripts`) to generate the changelog diff. This script expects a Github.com personal access token to exist at `~/github_token.txt` with \"repo\" permissions.\n4. Commit with message `Prepare release <version>`\n5. Push your branch to GitHub and make a PR\n6. Once your PR is merged, wait for the tests to pass on CircleCI for develop\n7. Create a \"Release\" on GitHub with the proper tag version and notes from the changelog.\n    - The tag should be identical to the version in `package.json`\n8. Run `yarn run publish:local`",
